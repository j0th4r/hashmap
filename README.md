# ðŸ§  JavaScript HashMap Implementation

This project is a custom implementation of a `HashMap` data structure in JavaScript, built from scratch to understand how hashing and key-value storage work internally. It supports dynamic resizing, handles collisions, and mimics the behavior of real-world hash maps using string keys.

## ðŸš€ Features

- String-only key support
- Custom hash function with overflow prevention
- Dynamic resizing based on a configurable load factor
- Collision handling using chaining (bucket arrays)
- Core methods:
  - `set(key, value)`
  - `get(key)`
  - `has(key)`
  - `remove(key)`
  - `length()`
  - `clear()`
  - `keys()`
  - `values()`
  - `entries()`
